/* polyline.c : encode chains of latitude/longitude coordinates as
 * printable ASCII text.
 */

/* https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/utilities/polylinealgorithm
 * This official polyline description is a very imperative, algorithmic one and
 * is missing some details.
 *
 * Here's my version:
 * Encoded polylines are variable-length base-64 encoding of latitude and
 * longitude coordinates. Each coordinate is encoded separately using exactly
 * the same method, in pairs (lat, lon). The first pair in a polyline is
 * absolute, but subsequent ones are relative. Saving deltas between points
 * makes the overall polyline much shorter since we use only as many bytes as
 * necessary for each point. The latitude and longitude are first converted to
 * integers: from floating point to fixed-point (5 decimal places). The
 * twos-complement representation of the number is left-shifted by one and
 * inverted (bitwise NOT) if it is negative. This has the effect of making the
 * lowest-order bit a sign bit and makes the number of significant bits
 * proportionate to the absolute value of the number. Starting from the
 * low-order bits we mask off chunks of 5 bits, giving a range of 0-31 for
 * each chunk. Chunks of zeros in the high order bits are dropped, with the
 * sixth bit (0x20) used to indicate whether additional chunks follow. These
 * six-bit chunks have a range of 0-63, and are shifted by 63 into the
 * printable character block at 63-126, with characters from the second half
 * at 95-126 making up the body of an encoded number and characters from the
 * first half at 63-94 (for which bit 6 is 0) terminating an encoded number.
 *
 * Results can be checked with:
 * https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/utilities/polylineutility
 *
 * For comparison see:
 * https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/encoding#optional
 * Repeated base-128 varints would be more efficient.
